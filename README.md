# Escape-Room-Pure-CSS-
Simple/Minimalistic Escape Room using CSS Only.

The project was done as a challenge to create a game without relying on Javascript for interactions/actions and to test certains CSS capabilities such as pseudo-conditionals and display/views swaps in order to generate different perspectives. 

ItÂ´s a very basic/short Escape room where the player can click around in order to nteract with objects or slighty change the room perspective until the solution is found.
